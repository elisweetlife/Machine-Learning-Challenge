# Machine Learning Challenge - Exoplanet Exploration
Machine Learning Challenge - Exoplanet Exploration




## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Comparison of each model's performance as well a summary about  findings and any assumptions made based on  model.
